## Mingyu Jeon (전민규)

I am a master’s student affiliated with the [Sun and Space Weather Laboratory](https://sunspaceweather.khu.ac.kr/) at Kyung Hee University, studying how to apply **machine learning** methods to **solar physics** and **space weather**. My research interests include **plasma physics** and **physics-informed machine learning**.
