	abstract = {Derivatives play a critical role in computational statistics, examples being Bayesian inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling and the training of neural networks. Automatic diﬀerentiation is a powerful tool to automate the calculation of derivatives and is preferable to more traditional methods, especially when diﬀerentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions. The implementation of automatic diﬀerentiation however requires some care to insure eﬃciency. Modern diﬀerentiation packages deploy a broad range of computational techniques to improve applicability, run time, and memory management. Among these techniques are operation overloading, regionbased memory, and expression templates. There also exist several mathematical techniques which can yield high performance gains when applied to complex algorithms. For example, semi-analytical derivatives can reduce by orders of magnitude the runtime required to numerically solve and diﬀerentiate an algebraic equation. Open and practical problems include the extension of current packages to provide more specialized routines, and ﬁnding optimal methods to perform higher-order diﬀerentiation.},
